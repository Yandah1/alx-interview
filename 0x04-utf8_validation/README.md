# UTF-8 Validation

This is a coding challenge that involves writing a method to determine if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. The goal is to implement a function called `validUTF8` in Python, which will take a list of integers as input and return `True` if the data is a valid UTF-8 encoding, and `False` otherwise.

## Algorithm

The algorithm for validating UTF-8 encoding involves the following steps:

1. Iterate over each integer in the data set.
2. Check if the integer represents a valid UTF-8 character by examining its binary representation.
3. If the integer is a single-byte character (i.e., the most significant bit is 0), move to the next integer.
4. If the integer is a multi-byte character, determine the number of bytes it represents by counting the leading 1s in its binary representation.
5. Check if the subsequent integers in the data set are valid continuation bytes by verifying that their binary representation starts with `10`.
6. If any of the integers fail the validation checks, return `False`.
7. If all integers pass the validation checks, return `True`.

## Prototype

The function prototype for the `validUTF8` method is as follows:

```python
def validUTF8(data):
    """
    Determines if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

    Args:
        data (List[int]): The data set represented by a list of integers.

    Returns:
        bool: True if data is a valid UTF-8 encoding, else False.
    """
    # Implementation goes here
```

You need to complete the implementation of the `validUTF8` method according to the algorithm described above.

## Constraints

Here are the constraints that need to be considered while implementing the `validUTF8` method:

- A character in UTF-8 can be 1 to 4 bytes long.
- The data set can contain multiple characters.
- The data will be represented by a list of integers.
- Each integer represents 1 byte of data, so only the 8 least significant bits of each integer need to be considered.
